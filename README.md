This repo contains all my work on [Coursera's Self-Driving Cars Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars), the details of each project is found along with project files in the README files.  \par

## Specialization Overview\par
This Specialization gives a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. I interacted with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)\f1\u8213?all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA.\f0\lang1033   \f1\lang9\par
Throughout \f0\lang1033 all\f1\lang9  courses, \f0\lang1033 there was interviews with \f1\lang9 industry experts who work at companies like Oxbotica and Zoox as they share insights about autonomous technology and how that is powering job growth within the field.\f0\lang1033   \f1\lang9\par
\f0\lang1033 I\f1\lang9  learn\f0\lang1033 ed\f1\lang9  from a highly realistic driving environment that features 3D pedestrian modelling and environmental conditions. When \f0\lang1033 I\f1\lang9  complete\f0\lang1033 d\f1\lang9  th\f0\lang1033 is\f1\lang9  Specialization successfully, \f0\lang1033 I\f1\lang9  \f0\lang1033 was\f1\lang9  able to build your own self-driving software stack\f0\lang1033 .  \par
