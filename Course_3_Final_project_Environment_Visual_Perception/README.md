# Course 3 Final Project | Environment Perception For Self-Driving Cars
  
In this project, I learned how to use object detection, tracking and image processing techniques to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment.  
This project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook
  
## Project Outline:
  
1. Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.
2. Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.
3. Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors.
4. Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
