    "To perform Dijkstra's search, we require a priority queue (or a min heap), which is defined as the `priority_dict` class. This class is accessed just as a standard dictionary is, except it orders the keys by their value. We can use the vertices as the keys to our priority queue, and their distance from the start as their value. For example, to set the distance of vertex `v` to the variable `dist`, we can do `open_queue[v] = dist`. To get the smallest value in the priority queue, we can use `priority_dict.pop_smallest()`. This returns a tuple of the vertex key and it's distance from the origin.\n",

    "The main input to the search is the `graph`, an OSMNX graph representation of the road network. The vertices are stored as keys, and as such the origin is given as input as `origin_key` and the goal is given as `goal_key`. To get the outgoing edges of a given vertex `u`, we can use `graph.out_edges([u], data=True)`. The return value of this is a list of tuples, each of which represent an outgoing edge. The second element of each tuple is the outgoing vertex at the other end of the edge. we can iterate over this list of tuples using:\n",
